# Machine Learning Utility

This is a simple machine learning utility that trains a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`, normalizes the input data, and saves the trained model for future predictions.

## Features
- Uses `LinearRegression` from `sklearn`
- Normalizes input features using `StandardScaler`
- Saves and loads the model using `joblib`

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
```sh
pip install numpy scikit-learn joblib
```

## Usage

### Training and Saving the Model
The script trains a linear regression model using a given dataset (NumPy arrays for input `X` and target `y`) and saves it as a `.pkl` file.

```python
import numpy as np
from ml_util import train_and_save_model

X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]])
y = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5])

train_and_save_model(X, y)
```

### Loading the Model and Making Predictions
Once the model is trained and saved, you can load it and make predictions as follows:

```python
from ml_util import load_model_and_predict

prediction = load_model_and_predict("model.pkl", [2, 3])
print(f"Predicted value: {prediction}")
```
